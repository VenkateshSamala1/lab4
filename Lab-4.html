      <ul>
        <li>Options for fonts on the web page:
          <ul>
            <li>As part of this lab, I made font choices such as using a google font called Oswald one for the main headings. In order to write the text, I used a font called playfair-display google font.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Main text-size & heading-size:
          <ul>
            <li>
                To distinguish between the main heading and subheading of a paragraph, I used a tag h2 with a font-size of 20 pixels instead of h1 which resembles the most important heading of that paragraph. As a user-friendly font-size, I used 20 pixels for all the texts in the paragraphs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Color choices : 
          <ul>
            <li>
            The main headings in each respective text are highlighted in blue color against a grey background.
            </li>
            <li>
                As a match to the black background color, I used red as the text color in the first paragraph. To make the text stand out more when hovering over the black background, I used red to the black background, and for references I used blue with zoom effects, to make the URL easy to read. Â 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Padding or Margins:
          <ul>
            <li>
                To adjust the heading in the middle of the div, I used 2 pixels of padding top and bottom. I also used a margin-left of 5 percent for paragraphs to get a left-side gap, a margin-top & bottom of 15 pixels to get a gap between paragraphs, and padding of 2 pixels in all directions to make paragraphs look attractive.
            </li>
